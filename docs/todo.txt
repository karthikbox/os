NOTES
######
pml4_base initially holds physical addr of kernel pml4 table, i.e 0x100000
this is okay during setting up kernel page tables

Keep this in mind, dereferncing base[511]. will page fault. since 0x100000 is not backed up by a page
so convert it into virt addres and then dereference it.
Eg:
*(((pml4 *)(get_virt_addr((uint64_t)base))) +511)

idt.s

in isr_common:
add code to change ds,gs,es,fs to SEG_UDCODE<<3|DPL_KERNEL before calling isr_common.
add code to change ds,gs,es,fs to SEG_UCODE<<3|DPL_KERNEL before iretq.This part should be added to trapret.

kmalloc
#######
what does kmalloc return on no available memory error. is it NULL? it has to be.
mark pages used for kmalloc data structures as used and never free them to prevent them from being overwritten
