SBUSH MANUAL
============
Path functionality
command our sbush supports: set PATH <give a path>
case1: set PATH $PATH:/usr/bin/abc -> this command appends /usr/bin/abc to the existing path
case2: set PATH /usr/bin/abc:$PATH -> this command prepends /usr/bin/abc to the existing path
case3: set PATH /usr/bin/abc -> this command removes the existing path and sets to /usr/bin/abc
case4: set PATH $PATH -> this command prints the current PATH

PS1 functionality
command our sbush supports: set PS1 "<give a word>"
example: set PS1 "sbush$ " -> this command changes the prompt to sbush$ 
example: set PS1 sbush$ -> this command throws an error

Pipe functionality
command our sbush supports: <command1> [args]|<command2> [args][|<command3> [args]] 
example: ls | head | tail
example: /bin/ls | head | tail 
example: ls -a -l  | head -3  |   tail -1

EXECUTE BINARY functionality
syntax 1:
        <filepath>
	If given input is a path(i.e contains '/') then it executes given filepath.
	If given input is just a filename(i.e no '/') then shell searches for given filename in every path dir and tries to execute
	example: sbush-shell$ rootfs/bin/sbush -> since input is a path, shell executes the given filepath.
	example: sbush-shell$ ls -> looks up ls in every path directory and executes it, if found.

EXECUTE SCRIPT functionality
syntax 1:
       Include the following line as the first line of the script and provide executable permissions to the script
       #! ./rootfs/bin/sbush
       example: bash-shell$ ./script.sh -> Can be run from outside our shell(sbush) as well
       example: sbush-shell$ ./script.sh -> can be given interactively within shell. Please note that it should be a filepath and not just a filename.
       Please make sure that the given file should have EXECUTE permissions set.
syntax 2:
       sbush <filepath>
       example: sbish-shell$ sbush /rootfs/test.dat -> executes the commands in the file test.dat.
       Please make sure that the given file should have READ permissions set.

NOTE: file CAN BE ANY extension.

LS functionality
syntax 1:
	./rootfs/bin/ls <directory path 1> <directory path 2> ...
	example: ./rootfs/bin/ls .. ./rootfs
	Prints contents of specified directories
syntax 2:
       ./rootfs/bin/ls
       Prints contents of current working directory by default
NOTE: This is implemented to test our stdlib.h.
